![Insomnia-Demonstration](https://github.com/Bkrendan12/Homework13/blob/main/imgs/insomnia.png)

## Tech Used

javascript, node.js, Express npm package

## Motivation

I needed a way to keep track of all my products in my store inventory, so this application was built to do just that.

## GIVEN a note-taking application

```
WHEN I run the application from the command line terminal
THEN I need to run 'npm run seed' to seed the sample data

WHEN I have seeded the sample data
THEN I will run 'npm start' in the command line to start the server and use the application

WHEN the application starts the server
THEN I will open up the Insomnia program to view and edit the seeded data

WHEN I path to categories, products and tags in the input
THEN I am able to view (GET), update (PUT), add (POST) and delete (DELETE) Categories/Products/Tags

```
